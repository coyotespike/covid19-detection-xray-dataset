Darshan Deshpande created [this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset) - give him an upvote!

He used [ieee8023's dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) and the [Zhang Lab data](https://github.com/coyotespike/zhanglab-chest-xrays) to create it. Both sources are included in this project.

This dataset is an excellent example of how the fundamental data needs to be processed into datasets ready to use for machine learning.
