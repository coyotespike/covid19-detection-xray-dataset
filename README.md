# covid19-detection-xray-dataset

Darshan Deshpande created [this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset) - give him an upvote!

He used [ieee8023's dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) and the [Zhang Lab data](https://github.com/coyotespike/zhanglab-chest-xrays) to create it. Both sources are included in this project.

He then augmented the dataset. I don't yet have the code used to generate it. Other datasets included in this repo will include steps to assemble from the fundamental data.

Still this dataset is an excellent example of how the fundamental data needs to be processed into datasets ready to use for machine learning.
